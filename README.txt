This is my first project on coding the quran in prolog.

Source : quran.com as an english traduction "sahih international".

X is instanciated with allah but we have to dig more
X is Allah means that god(X) is that allah is a god
to dig more we have to proove that X is the god as it is believed in monotheism

Y is us
Y is seen as lambda anyone

when it is said we it's difficult depending on the context
because sometimes it's we as god
and sometimes it's we as a human prayer

rab -> lord(X)
malik -> sovereign(X) so sovereign(allah) is al malik
illah -> is_god(X, Y)

is_god in general is coded by is_god(X, Y) X is allah and allah is the god of Y
